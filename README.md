This is a collection of terraform configuration files thast you try out. I will keep adding other resources. I have been creating this to mainly for people I work with to try out and get familliar with terraform

Use the code by cutting and pasting it into your favourite development tool.

Just in case

1. download and install terraform
2. Install your IDE or editor
3. Make sure to have your code complete plugins installed to check for errors

Caveat: Make sure that the code works. I cannot be held responsible for ANDY code you choose to run in your environment. Understand how much it is going to cost you in AWS before running anything.

Best Wishes
